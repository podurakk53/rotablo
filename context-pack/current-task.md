# Current Task Context

**Phase:** Supabase bootstrap and core schema completed, auth/RLS next

**Active Goal:** Continue implementation from a clean canonical surface: editorial route publishing, routeSession-based session flow, deterministic static route warnings, and Supabase-first execution.

## Current Reality

- Canonical planning docs now live only under `docs/` in this repo.
- Workspace-root historical docs were moved to `../docs-archive/`.
- `mobile/` remains a useful early client scaffold.
- `backend/` and `scripts/` remain exploratory and are not the active source of truth.
- Cost discipline is `free-first` and `single-project-first` until pilot value is proven.

## Immediate Priorities

1. Keep the canonical docs and task list aligned before writing new code.
2. Implement auth and RLS from the canonical docs before public/mobile work.
3. Bootstrap editorial data entry next: `route`, `stage`, `sideQuest`, `hazardProfile`.
4. Build public route browsing after auth boundaries are in place.
5. Build `routeSession` start / resume / planning flow before warning implementation.
6. Build the static route warning system only with the locked trait set, rule table, and compatibility rules.
7. Keep the implementation on the cost-minimizing path: one Supabase project, Studio-first admin, minimal media.

## Do Not Reintroduce

- old `tripPlan` / `tripSelection` model
- separate `savedRoute` runtime object
- user-generated route builder as a V1 core feature
- GPS tracking, geofence, or background weather polling
- Fastify-first or microservice-first architecture
- Excel-first product thinking
